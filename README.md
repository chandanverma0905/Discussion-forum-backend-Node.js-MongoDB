# Discussion-forum-backend-Nodejs-MongoDB
I have created a backend for Discussion Forum using Nodejs and MongoDB. Here users will first have to register with their fullName, username and email. After that users can post their discussions with their usernames. Users can also update their discussion posts. Users can comment on each others post also.
